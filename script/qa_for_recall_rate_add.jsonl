{"Q": "What is one method mentioned to improve the stability of MOF-based superstructures?", "A": "The assembly of colloidal MOF particles facilitates the formation of MOF-based superstructures, offering control over their spatial geometries and, consequently, their anisotropic properties. Advances in synthesizing stable, monodisperse colloidal MOF particles have positioned them as a distinguished class of polyhedral particles for assembly into oriented superstructures. This progress is expected to expand the range of attainable superstructures, which could lead to intricate and unconventional-oriented assemblies. Nonetheless, it is essential to acknowledge that the assembly of MOF particles remains a complex and challenging task. There exists a demand for continued advances in synthetic methodologies aimed at precisely regulating MOF particle interactions and their interactions within their environment. Another important aspect to consider regarding oriented MOF-based superstructures prepared using reported assembly methods is their weak cohesion, which limits their practical applicability. The stability of the superstructures can be improved by using a polymer to bind the oriented MOF particles together. However, this methodology faces the combined challenges of simultaneously enhancing the mechanical stability of the superstructures while preserving the order and intrinsic porosity of the MOF particles in larger domains."}
{"Q": "What was the observed change in crystal morphology after the Cu2(BDC)2DABCO films were exposed to 80% relative humidity and liquid water?", "A": "Recently, Brandner et al. demonstrated a similar concept for the MOF-to-MOF transformation from 3D-oriented films of Cu2(BDC)2DABCO to 3D-oriented Cu2(BDC)2. The Cu2(BDC)2DABCO films were prepared via the heteroepitaxial growth from sacrificial Cu(OH)2 nanostructures and exposed to different water loadings. Specifically, when films were exposed to 80% relative humidity (RH) and liquid water, SEM images displayed a change in morphology from cuboid crystals (Cu2(BDC)2DABCO) to smaller plate-like crystals of Cu2(BDC)2. After exposure to the humid environment, IR-spectroscopy revealed the absence of the DABCO pillar ligand and COO\u2212 bands matched with the Cu2(BDC)2 phase. The authors monitored the MOF-to-MOF transformation via OOP and IP XRD. The reported IP azimuthal intensity profiles showed that the maxima of the (100) reflection of pristine Cu2(BDC)2DABCO coincided in position with the maxima of the (100) reflection of newly formed Cu2(BDC)2."}
{"Q": "What is a key requirement for MOF particles in external field-assisted methods to form well-oriented domains?", "A": "When comparing the emerging methods suitable for the fabrication of 3D-oriented MOF superstructures, we can identify common major challenges. The first is the need for precise control over the morphology and size of the MOF crystals. Both the assembly and the external-field methods (Section 2 and 3 respectively) are based on the assembly of pre-synthesized MOF particles into oriented MOF superstructures. For the assembly method, the monodispersity of the MOF particle size is an important parameter to afford large 3D-oriented domains, indeed dimensional variations in particle size result in highly defective or disordered superstructures. External field-assisted methods necessitate MOF particles with a high degree of anisometry to generate a robust response (i.e., torque) to magnetic or electric fields, resulting in well-oriented domains."}
{"Q": "What is the main benefit of optimizing the I2/I\u2212 ratio and I3\u2212 concentration in CEMA Zn\u2013I batteries?", "A": "In this study, we demonstrate the oxidative effect of (OTf)\u2212on iodide and triiodide species and utilize this effect to fabricate a novel type of CEM mixture for CEMA Zn\u2013I batteries. By exploiting the CEM mixture, we were able to produce an iodine host cathode and aqueous electrolyte through a facile in situ filtration process. During battery operation, we explored the competitive effects of the iodide redox and the HER processes in terms of I2/I\u2212ratio and I3\u2212concentration. Severe ionization within the electrolyte would lower the critical potential for HER and facilitate its aggravation. However, by optimizing the I2/I\u2212ratio and I3\u2212concentration, we were able to achieve long-term cycling capability and high-rate performance with well-suppressed HER. Our findings suggest that the CEMA Zn\u2013I batteries constructed based on the oxidation effects of (OTf)\u2212on iodide species represent a promising strategy for advancing portable and low-cost aqueous Zn\u2013I batteries."}
{"Q": "What is the main component of the aqueous electrolyte used in the CEMA Zn-I battery?", "A": "Herein, we present a self-expelling strategy toward iodide species by harnessing the inherent oxidation effect of trifluoromethanesulfonate ((OTf)\u2212) in Zn(OTf)2 aqueous electrolyte. Upon the addition of I3\u2212 species in the Zn(OTf)2 aqueous electrolyte, (OTf)\u2212 induced the formation of iodine sediment particles, leading to a mutualistic mixture of iodine sediment particles and aqueous electrolyte. Based on this mixture, we developed a cathode/electrolyte mutualistic aqueous (CEMA) Zn\u2013I battery. During battery assembly, the iodine cathode and aqueous electrolyte were simultaneously formed through a facile in situ filtering process, where the iodine and iodide species were retained by the carbon host cathode while the aqueous electrolyte further penetrated until reaching the metallic Zn anode."}
{"Q": "What did the optimized pouch-type CEMA Zn\u2013I batteries show after repeated galvanostatic charge/discharge tests?", "A": "The optimized pouch-type CEMA Zn\u2013I batteries showed no distinct swelling after repeated galvanostatic charge/discharge tests, suggesting efficient inhibition of the HER. Our work provides proof of concept for the repelling effect of electrolyte on iodide species owing to its inherent oxidation ability, promoting the development of advanced aqueous Zn\u2013I batteries."}
{"Q": "What is the main product of the CO2 reduction reaction catalyzed by iminium-CONs?", "A": "In summary, we have successfully synthesized a cobalt\u2013phthalocyanine-based electrocatalyst in the form of positively charged covalent organic nanosheets (iminium-CONs) for CO2-to-CH3OH conversion. The incorporation of quaternary iminium groups facilitates the generation of ultrathin nanosheets and ensures the uniform dispersion of cobalt active sites. Moreover, the cationic framework suppresses the competitive HER by electrostatic repulsion between iminium moieties and protons. The resulting iminium-CONs present high activity for six-electron reduction of CO2 to CH3OH and exhibit a partial current density of 90.3 mA cm\u22122 with FECH3OH of 38.7% at \u22120.74 V using a flow cell."}
{"Q": "What is the main improvement of iminium-CONs over pristine CoTAPc and neutral imine-CONs in terms of methanol production?", "A": "Here, ultrathin, cationic, and cobalt-phthalocyanine-based covalent organic nanosheets (iminium-CONs) are reported for electrochemical CO2-to-CH3OH conversion. The integration of quaternary iminium groups enables the formation of ultrathin morphology with uniformly anchored cobalt active sites, which are pivotal for facilitating rapid multi-electron transfer. Moreover, the cationic iminium-CONs exhibit a lower activity for hydrogen evolution side reaction. Consequently, iminium-CONs manifest significantly enhanced selectivity for methanol production, as evidenced by a remarkable 711% and 270% improvement in methanol partial current density (jCH3OH) compared to pristine CoTAPc and neutral imine-CONs, respectively."}
{"Q": "What is the d-band center energy level of CoTlminiumPc?", "A": "To further understand how the peripheral functional groups change the electronic structures of the catalysts, the density of states (DOS) and Co d-band center energy levels of CoTAPc, CoTIminePc, and CoTlminiumPc were computed. Compared to CoTAPc and CoTIminePc, CoTlminiumPc manifested a significant shift in electronic structure. The d-band centers energy levels of CoTAPc, CoTIminePc, and CoTlminiumPc were calculated to be \u22120.91, \u22120.93, and \u22120.76 eV, suggesting that CoTlminiumPc has the strongest absorption ability. These results were consistent with the CO binding energy calculated in Figure 5b."}
