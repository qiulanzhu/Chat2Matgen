{"Q": "What substrates were used for the integration of two-dimensional freestanding TMDs in this study?", "A": "In conclusion, we have shown that the integration of two-dimensional freestanding TMDs is possible. Integration was performed using cheap and scalable substrates, i.e., ZnO NRs grown by CBD. As representative TMDs, 1-L MoS 2, WS 2, and WSe 2 were employed in this study. The integrated PL intensities of 1-L MoS 2, WS 2, and WSe 2 were found to be respectively 153, 50, and 158 times higher than the same 1-L TMDs transferred on SiO 2 substrates. Moreover, the blue shift in the position of the A exciton peak, observed for all the TMDs deposited on the NRs, confirmed that the enhancement in PL intensity was induced by strain relaxation. The analysis of exciton peaks embedded in PL spectra of 1-L TMDs on ZnO NRs supports that enhanced PL intensity is not considerably influenced by charge transfer phenomena. The enormous increases in Raman intensity and distinctive variations of the peak positions, observed in the Raman spectra of TMDs on the NRs, indicated that the strain was relaxed, compared with that of TMDs transferred on SiO 2. Fairly consistent distributions of PL and Raman intensities were observed in all the TMDs on the NRs, which were further confirmed by confocal PL and Raman spectroscopy. All the experimental results confirmed that the TMDs on the ZnO NRs were freestanding crystals. The same approach can also be extended to graphene and other TMD materials, and therefore also used to investigate the thermal properties.

More generally, the electrothermal technique presented here can be applied to various crystalline polar substrates, ideally with even lower phonon absorption loss, for example, single crystalline SiC. With lower phonon absorption loss, the electrothermal modulation depth is expected to be further enhanced.

Initially, the fabrication of nanofiber scaffolds is conducted via MBS technique. The MBS method shares several key advantages: allowing the fabrication of ultrafine fibrinogen-coated PCL/SF core–shell nanofiber with an average diameter of 65 nm; providing a facile way toward a large-area nanofiber scaffold (140 × 40 cm^2) with large specific surface area, excellent gas permeability, and strong tensile strength, which offer great potential for further use as skin regeneration. The as-prepared SNS possesses superior mechanical strength, wettability, and excellent cell adhesion, promoting the recruitment and proliferation of fibroblasts to form a skin tissue. In vivo experiments indicate that it promotes collagen deposition, neovascularization, as well as granulation tissue, hair follicles, and new regular tissue construction to easily form skin. More importantly, we apply the large-area SNS to the abdominal skin defect; the results demonstrate that the SNS has excellent protective and anti-infection abilities and promotes the tissue regeneration. In general, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of a new kind of skin regeneration derived from SNS.

Advances in synthesizing stable, monodisperse colloidal MOF particles have positioned them as a distinguished class of polyhedral particles for assembly into oriented superstructures. This progress is expected to expand the range of attainable superstructures, which could lead to intricate and unconventional-oriented assemblies. Nonetheless, it is essential to acknowledge that the assembly of MOF particles remains a complex and challenging task. There exists a demand for continued advances in synthetic methodologies aimed at precisely regulating MOF particle interactions and their interactions within their environment. Another important aspect to consider regarding oriented MOF-based superstructures prepared using reported assembly methods is their weak cohesion, which limits their practical applicability.

For the assembly method, the monodispersity of the MOF particle size is an important parameter to afford large 3D-oriented domains, indeed dimensional variations in particle size result in highly defective or disordered superstructures.

{"Q": "What is the main improvement of iminium-CONs over pristine CoTAPc and neutral imine-CONs in terms of methanol production?", "A": "Here, ultrathin, cationic, and cobalt-phthalocyanine-based covalent organic nanosheets (iminium-CONs) are reported for electrochemical CO2-to-CH3OH conversion. The integration of quaternary iminium groups enables the formation of ultrathin morphology with uniformly anchored cobalt active sites, which are pivotal for facilitating rapid multi-electron transfer. Moreover, the cationic iminium-CONs exhibit a lower activity for hydrogen evolution side reaction. Consequently, iminium-CONs manifest significantly enhanced selectivity for methanol production, as evidenced by a remarkable 711% and 270% improvement in methanol partial current density (jCH3OH) compared to pristine CoTAPc and neutral imine-CONs, respectively.", "docs": ["Moreover,thecationic iminium-CONsexhibitaloweractivityforhydrogenevolutionsidereaction.

{"Q": "What is the d-band center energy level of CoTlminiumPc?", "A": "To further understand how the peripheral functional groups change the electronic structures of the catalysts, the density of states (DOS) and Co d-band center energy levels of CoTAPc, CoTIminePc, and CoTlminiumPc were computed. Compared to CoTAPc and CoTIminePc, CoTlminiumPc manifested a significant shift in electronic structure. The d-band centers energy levels of CoTAPc, CoTIminePc, and CoTlminiumPc were calculated to be −0.91, −0.93, and −0.76 eV, suggesting that CoTlminiumPc has the strongest absorption ability. These results were consistent with the CO binding energy calculated in Figure 5b.", "docs": ["It is worthy to note that the BE of Pd in PdBiTe ANSs show posi-tive shift relative to commercial Pd black, which means that the introduction of Au can reduce the BE of Pd and the downshift of the d-band center of Pd.
